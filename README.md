The app has error handling. Some app which is always going to ensure that no wrong or unexpected inputs are being made which makes the app crash. They give clear and constructive feedback to users, so that the users can help them find valid entries.version control is managed by using GitHub. The progress of the project is being tracked in a GitHub repository and it is committed and pushed every now and then. This app is generally a simple yet an efficient meal planning tool to choose meals.
